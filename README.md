## swipl-owly

owl utilities enhancing swipl semweb library

## Examples

See the t/ directory for unit tests

## Relationship to Thea

Thea is intended for heavy duty OWL work. See: https://github.com/vangelisv/thea

One disadvantage is that we cannot take advantage of the many excellent rdf libs in swipl, as thea rewrites the triples into prolog unit clauses.

In contract owly is intended as a lightweight layer on top of the existing swipl semweb stack.
